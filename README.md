C# Windows Form .NET Folder Organizer 

Use this and the associated text file to organize any folder you choose and the files within on a Windows operating system.
Text file works by putting a one word folder name at the beginning, and then listing all file extensions you want included
afterwards on that line. If someone wants to modify this to use readAll(), string.Split[' '], and then go through the array
looking at each string for ones not containing a period in them, go ahead. More than anything, I'm curious to see how one
would go about creating a GUI for creating/showing the organization parameters.
